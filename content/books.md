title: "Books recommendations"
---

The list below includes books that have shaped my perspective and influenced the
way I live my life, as well as some that I find thought-provoking and entertaining.
These are books that I can wholeheartedly recommend.

This list is regularly updated. Be sure to revisit often!


## Behavioral economics
#### Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kahneman Daniel.
This book defines the dual processes that influence our thoughts and decisions.
It distinguishes between the intuitive, quick "System 1" and the more analytical, slow
"System 2." This book has profoundly changed my understanding of how decisions
are made, highlighting the often unconscious influence of our immediate reactions
versus our considered responses. It's insights have reshaped my perception of
rationality and decision-making, and the ideas of this book can be found implicitly
in many of the books in this list.

## Philosophy
#### The Black Swan  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
This book has profoundly influenced how I assess the future and regard those
who claim to predict it. It offers a critical look at the retrospective analyses
of historical events, revealing the limitations and often the hubris of forecasting.

## Biology
#### The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins.
This book introduced me to the concepts of evolution, natural selection, and the genetic
drivers behind our behaviors. It explains how selfish genetic behavior ultimately leads to
the sophisticated social behaviors we observe in nature. Additionally, it provides a solid
foundation for understanding our place in the universe and how we arrived here.

## Psychology
#### Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise" by Anders Ericsso
This fantastic book that replaces enigmatic term 'talent' with 'skill', which is nothing more than
highly structured data in long-term memory. This data is achieved at birth but through very
specific practice that can be attended by everyone.

## Troubleshooting
#### Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems by David J Agans.
This is the best account I've come across on how to hunt for system failures.
Though it is written from the perspective of an embedded software engineer, the methods
outlined in this book can be applied to any system experiencing issues.
