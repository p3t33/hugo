I am a big believer in the importance of knowing where I am heading, and
the best way to get that prospective is by exposure to new things.

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog,
conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall,
set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve
equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
fight efficiently, die gallantly.
**Specialization is for insects**"

â€” Robert A. Heinlein.

I am Kobi, an embedded software developer, and this site is where I share my thoughts and
the things I have learned along the way.
